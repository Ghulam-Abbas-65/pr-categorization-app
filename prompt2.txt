Keywords: specialized waste, recycling, hazardous materials, waste sorting, disposal programs. Examples: Facility-wide waste recycling programs, disposal of hazardous materials, waste bin collection by specialized services, implementation of waste sorting initiatives.
  - **Manpower**: Provision of personnel for operational tasks, excluding cleaning services, such as driving, stewarding, or moving. Housekeeping staff are classified under Housekeeping, not Manpower. Keywords: staff, personnel, drivers, stewards, movers, non-cleaning. Examples: Deployment of facility drivers, assignment of stewarding personnel, hiring of movers for facility relocations, provision of non-cleaning operational staff.
  - **Housekeeping**: Routine and specialized cleaning services performed by dedicated staff for facility upkeep, including daily cleaning, deep cleaning, and routine trash collection or waste removal when these tasks are part of housekeeping duties. PR titles like "Cleaner Services" typically indicate Housekeeping when associated with personnel-driven cleaning tasks, even if items include terms like "trash" or "disposal." Keywords: housekeeping, cleaning staff, routine cleaning, facility upkeep, trash collection, waste removal by staff, deep cleaning, daily cleaning. Examples: Daily cleaning of facility interiors by housekeeping staff, routine trash collection by housekeeping teams as part of facility upkeep, deep cleaning of common areas by housekeeping personnel, provision of dedicated cleaning staff for office maintenance, regular facility sanitation by cleaning teams, waste removal by housekeeping staff during routine cleaning.

**Instructions**:

- Select **only one** subcategory from the list above based on the definitions provided.
- Analyze the purchase requisition and item/service as a unified whole to capture their combined intent and context, prioritizing the overall purpose of the task over specific keywords. For example, a PR titled "Cleaner Services" with an item like "trash collection" typically indicates Housekeeping when the task is performed by dedicated cleaning staff as part of facility upkeep, not Waste Management, even if keywords like "trash" or "disposal" are present.
- Evaluate the entire PR description and item/service together to determine the task’s purpose, ensuring that potentially misleading terms (e.g., "trash" for housekeeping duties, "cleaning" for housekeeping tasks, "landscaping" for groundskeeping) are interpreted in the context of the PR and item combined.
- Follow these decision criteria to resolve ambiguity, especially for key distinctions:
  1. **Holistic Task Intent and Context**: Determine the primary goal by evaluating the PR and item/service as a unified whole. For Hard FM: Structural work (e.g., concrete repairs) is Civil Works; non-structural upgrades (e.g., flooring) are Construction & Renovation; integrated electrical-mechanical systems (e.g., chillers) are Electro Mechanical. For Soft FM: Routine grounds maintenance (e.g., lawn mowing, soil treatment, fountain servicing) is Groundskeeping, even if labeled "landscaping"; aesthetic or design-focused environmental enhancements (e.g., garden layouts) are Landscape; routine or specialized cleaning by dedicated staff (e.g., daily cleaning, trash collection, deep cleaning by housekeeping teams) is Housekeeping; task-based cleaning without personnel (e.g., sanitizing surfaces) is Cleaning; specialized waste handling (e.g., recycling programs) is Waste Management; non-cleaning personnel provision (e.g., drivers) is Manpower.
  2. **System or Service Focus**: Identify the primary system or service. For example: Electrical wiring is Electrical (Hard FM); pump repair is Mechanical (Hard FM); surface cleaning without staff is Cleaning (Soft FM); cleaning by dedicated staff is Housekeeping (Soft FM); specialized waste handling is Waste Management (Soft FM); non-cleaning staffing is Manpower (Soft FM).
  3. **Mechanical vs. Electro Mechanical**: For Hard FM, if the task involves standalone mechanical components (e.g., pumps, gears), choose Mechanical. If it involves systems with electrical and mechanical integration (e.g., HVAC, chillers), choose Electro Mechanical.
  4. **Structural vs. Non-Structural**: For Hard FM, if the task modifies the building’s structural core (e.g., foundations), choose Civil Works. If it involves aesthetic or fit-out work (e.g., walls, floors), choose Construction & Renovation.
  5. **Groundskeeping vs. Landscape**: For Soft FM, if the task involves routine, operational maintenance of grounds or environmental features (e.g., lawn mowing, water feature servicing, soil treatment, irrigation upkeep), choose Groundskeeping, even if the PR includes terms like "landscaping." If the task involves design, installation, or aesthetic enhancements of environmental features (e.g., garden layouts, tree planting, floral arrangements), choose Landscape.
  6. **Housekeeping vs. Cleaning vs. Waste Management vs. Manpower**: For Soft FM:
        - Choose **Housekeeping** if the task involves routine or specialized cleaning services performed by dedicated staff, including daily cleaning, deep cleaning, or routine trash collection when these are part of housekeeping duties. For example, a PR like "Cleaner Services" with an item like "trash collection" or "waste removal" typically indicates Housekeeping when performed by cleaning staff as part of facility upkeep, even if keywords like "trash" or "disposal" are present.
        - Choose **Cleaning** if the task involves task-based cleaning activities without dedicated personnel (e.g., sanitizing surfaces, washing windows, or cleaning equipment).
        - Choose **Waste Management** if the task involves specialized collection, sorting, recycling, or disposal of waste not performed by housekeeping staff (e.g., waste recycling programs, hazardous waste disposal).
        - Choose **Manpower** if the task involves provision of personnel for non-cleaning operational tasks (e.g., drivers, stewards).
  7. **Equipment Context**: For Soft FM, if equipment is mentioned, classify as Groundskeeping if it involves routine servicing for environmental purposes (e.g., fountain filters, irrigation systems). For Hard FM, classify as Electro Mechanical for integrated systems (e.g., chillers) or Mechanical for standalone components.
  8. **Specialization**: If the task requires specialized technical skills (e.g., electrical engineering for Electrical), choose a Hard FM subcategory. If it involves general operational skills (e.g., cleaning, groundskeeping, housekeeping), choose a Soft FM subcategory.
- Do not make up or infer any new subcategory.
- Respond with the subcategory name only (e.g., "Housekeeping," "Groundskeeping").
