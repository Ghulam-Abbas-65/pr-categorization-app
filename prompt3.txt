- If the list of functions is empty (e.g., for Housekeeping, Waste Management, Groundskeeping, Pest Control, Security Services, Integrated FM, Civil Works, or FLS), return "None".
- Analyze the purchase requisition and item/service as a unified whole to capture their combined intent and context, prioritizing the overall purpose of the task over generic keywords. For example:
  - Under {level2} Electrical, a PR like "Supply of Backup Power Components" with an item like "UPS battery pack supply" should map to Power Backup Systems, as it focuses on core components.
  - Under {level2} Electrical, a PR like "UPS System Setup" with an item like "power cables for equipment" should map to Electrical Cables, Hardware & Supplies, as it focuses on cabling.
  - Under {level2} Electrical, a PR like "Supply and Installation of UPS Batteries" with an item like "UPS Battery Rack and Cabling" should map to Electrical Cables, Hardware & Supplies, as it focuses on racks and cabling, not core UPS batteries.
  - Under {level2} Housekeeping, a PR like "Cleaner Services" with an item like "trash collection" should return "None" as Housekeeping has no Level 3 functions.
- Evaluate the entire PR description and item/service together, ensuring alignment with the given {level1} and {level2} context to avoid misclassification (e.g., do not classify an Electrical cabling task as Power Backup Systems, or a Housekeeping task as Cleaning).
- Follow these decision criteria to resolve ambiguity, especially for {level2} Electrical:
  1. **Primary Task Focus**: Determine the main purpose by evaluating the PR and item/service together within the {level1} and {level2} context. For example:
     - For {level2} Electrical, choose Power Backup Systems for supplying or maintaining core UPS units, battery packs, or generators; Electrical Cables, Hardware & Supplies for supplying cables, connectors, or racks; Installation & Maintenance Services for installing or repairing systems; Measuring, Observing and Testing Instruments for testing or diagnostics.
     - For {level2} Electro Mechanical, choose BMS for integrated control systems like CCTV, HVAC Systems for cooling/heating, or Elevators for lift repairs.
     - For {level2} Cleaning, choose Indoor Cleaning for office sanitization, Outdoor Cleaning for pathway washing, or Sewerage Cleaning for drain clearing.
  2. **Core System vs. Component**: Differentiate tasks involving core systems from supporting components. For example:
     - For {level2} Electrical, choose Power Backup Systems for core UPS units, battery packs, or generators (e.g., "supplying UPS battery packs"); Electrical Cables, Hardware & Supplies for cables, connectors, or racks (e.g., "supplying power cables or battery racks"); or Switchgears for control panels.
     - For {level2} Mechanical, choose Pumps for pump units or Valves for valve components.
     - For {level2} Electro Mechanical, choose BMS for integrated control systems or HVAC Systems for cooling units.
  3. **Service vs. Supply**: Distinguish tasks based on whether they involve providing a service or supplying a component. For example:
     - For {level2} Electrical, choose Installation & Maintenance Services for installation, repair, or maintenance (e.g., "installing UPS systems"); Power Backup Systems for supplying core components (e.g., "supplying UPS battery packs"); or Electrical Cables, Hardware & Supplies for supplying components (e.g., "supplying power cables or battery racks").
     - For {level2} Manpower, choose Housekeeping for cleaning services or Movers for relocation services.
  4. **Testing vs. Installation**: Differentiate diagnostic or testing tasks from installation or maintenance. For example:

     - Choose Measuring, Observing and Testing Instruments for keywords like "voltmeter," "multimeter," "performance test," "testing service" (e.g., "performance testing of UPS systems").
     - Choose Motors for keywords like "electric motor," "rotor," "fan motor," "pump motor" (e.g., "repairing HVAC fan motors").
  6. **Electrical vs. Electro Mechanical Differentiation**: For {level2} Electrical, select functions for standalone electrical components or services (e.g., Power Backup Systems for UPS battery packs, Motors for motors). For {level2} Electro Mechanical, select BMS for integrated control systems (e.g., CCTV, access controls) or systems combining electrical and mechanical components (e.g., HVAC Systems, Elevators).
  7. **Location Specificity**: For {level2} Cleaning or Landscape, prioritize location-based functions (e.g., Indoor Cleaning vs. Outdoor Cleaning, Indoor vs. Outdoor for Landscape).
  8. **Specialization**: For {level2} Cleaning, choose specialized functions like Tank Cleaning or Sewerage Cleaning for specific systems; otherwise, choose General Cleaning for broad tasks. For {level2} Electrical, choose specialized functions like Power Backup Systems for core UPS components or Measuring, Observing and Testing Instruments for testing over Installation & Maintenance Services for generic tasks.
  9. **Personnel Role**: For {level2} Manpower, choose the function matching the personnel type (e.g., Driver for driving staff, Housekeeping for cleaning staff).
  10. **Empty List Handling**: If {level3_options} is empty (e.g., for Housekeeping, Waste Management, Groundskeeping, Pest Control, Security Services, Integrated FM, Civil Works, or FLS), return "None" without inferring a function.
- Do not generate or infer any new function not listed in {level3_options}.
- Respond with the specific function name only (e.g., "Power Backup Systems", "BMS") or "None" if no functions are available.
